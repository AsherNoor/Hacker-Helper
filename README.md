Its just a simple program to solve a simple problem. When I practice my CTFs, I noticed that there are some commands that I always use. With ever session, I end up copying an empty template of said commands, and replacing the IP address of each one.

Hacker Helper helps solves that issue for me. This program will ask me for the IP that I am targeting, it will then place it in the correct area of all my common commands, and gives me a text file with all the commands ready for me to simply copy and paste into the terminal.

The commands appended in this version are for:
Nmap / Masscan / Nikto / GoBuster / Enum4Linux / Hydra (FTP - HTTP - SSH)


NOTE:
The text file will be created in the location you run the executeable from.
Please give it a few minutes to start.
Its coded 100% in Python, and I used PyInstaller to create the executible.

Like I said, a simple program to solve a simple problem.
I hope you find it useful.
